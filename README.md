#Hack North Campus

Overview: Provide North Campus with a neat technology hack along the lines of the Beyster Lights.

##Giant Arcade

###Details
* Utilize an already existing grid-like structure on North Campus
  * Must be large enough to allow for games like Pong, Snake, Game of Life, Tron, Breakout, potentially Pac-man if multi-coloured
  * Minimum number of pixels: 16x16
    * Do we need to make it square?
    * Lots of long hallways
    * 32x20 grid -> 16:10 ratio, very nice
  * Diffusing panels with lights?
* Build up a server that will run and people can hook in to
  * Allows control of the grid too
  * People can write their own JS applets using the API that'll display things
  * Keep a gallery of user-submitted applets, potentially let people vote on them

###Logistics
* Campus Contact: TBD
* Where?
  * Potential: side of BBB to the right of the main entrance
  * Server room of BBB
* How do we get the light-grid up?
