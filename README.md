#Hack North Campus

Overview: Provide North Campus with a neat technology hack along the lines of the Beyster Lights.

##Giant Arcade

###Details
* Utilize an already existing grid-like structure on North Campus
  * Must be large enough to allow for games like Pong, Snake, Game of Life, Breakout, potentially Pac-man if multi-coloured
* iOS and Android apps to control the arcade machine
  * Hooks in in-turn, potentially over bluetooth over Wi-fi
  * Allows selection of game, potentially allow two player if the game allows it

###Logistics
* Campus Contact: TBD
* Where?
  * Potential: side of BBB to the right of the main entrance
* How do we get the light-grid up?
