#Hack North Campus

Overview: Provide North Campus with a neat technology hack along the lines of the Beyster Lights.

##Giant Arcade

###Details
* Utilize an already existing grid-like structure on North Campus
  * Must be large enough to allow for games like Pong, Snake, Game of Life, Tron, Breakout, potentially Pac-man if multi-coloured
  * Minimum number of pixels: 16x16
  * Split-fold Display -> Will allow us to "create" a 64x64 grid
* iOS and Android apps to control the arcade machine
  * Hooks in in-turn, potentially over Bluetooth over Wi-Fi
  * Allows selection of game, potentially allow two player if the game allows it
  * Do we want something dedicated though?
* Spectators can have an effect on the game somehow

###Logistics
* Campus Contact: TBD
* Where?
  * Potential: side of BBB to the right of the main entrance
* How do we get the light-grid up?
